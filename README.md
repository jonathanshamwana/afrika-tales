Afrika Tales: Be the hero of your story. 

Hey! Kudos to you for giving this a go. 
Remember, the 15 minutes of setup you put in now will result in an infinity of custom stories for your children. 
Be sure to send us one of your stories at info@afrika-tales.com

STEP ONE: Head to replit.com and create a free account. 

STEP TWO. Once you've created an account, click the blue button in the top left corner that says "Create new Repl". You want to choose the template "Python", name it whatever you want, then you're good to go. This is where you'll paste the code we give you.  

STEP THREE: Have a look at the files to the left of this README and you'll see a file called "ai.py". Click on it, copy all the code, and paste it into your new Repl. 

STEP FOUR: In line 9 of the code, you'll see this: os.getenv("API_KEY"). This is my private access key that gives me access to the AI technology. In the next step, I'll show you how to create your own in 2 minutes!

STEP FIVE: Head to openai.com and create a free account. Once you've created an account, click on your profile picture in the top left corner, then click on "API Keys".

STEP SIX: On this page, you'll find a button called "Create new secret key." Click on it. You won't be able to see this key again, so make sure to copy it to your clipboard. 

STEP SEVEN: Paste your secret key where my access key (mentioned in step five) was. Then, all you gotta do is put it in quotation marks. 

STEP EIGHT. So, it costs $0.02 per bedtime story because Open AI charges 2c for the cover image. So before the final step of running the code (and having your first story!), enter your billing information on openai.com. Pro tip: set a max bill of $5, so you get notified if your bill ever exceeds that. 

STEP NINE: Run the code, and voila, you've got a story!

If you've stuck with me this far, well done! That's honestly worth a medal. If you need some more help, email us at info@afrika-tales.com. 
Once the full product is live, where you can generate stories on our site in seconds, we'll notify you first!

Ciao. Adios. A bientot.
